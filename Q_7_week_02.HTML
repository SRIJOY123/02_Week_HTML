    Sure! Here's an unordered list of 5 programming quotes using the `<ul>` tag:

        <ul>
          <li>"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler</li>
          <li>"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." - Harold Abelson</li>
          <li>"The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple." - Grady Booch</li>
          <li>"The best error message is the one that never shows up." - Thomas Fuchs</li>
          <li>"Don't worry if it doesn't work right. If everything did, you'd be out of a job." - Mosher's Law of Software Engineering</li>
        </ul>
        
        These quotes reflect the importance of writing code that is not only functional but also readable, maintainable, and user-friendly.
